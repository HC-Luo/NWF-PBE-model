# NWF-PBE-model
Primitive barotropic equation model of numerical weather forecast based on Python

Update: I've added wind quiver in main.

=======================================================

Update: I have put the subroutines together in file "subroutine", now you only have to download "subroutine" and latest "main".

=======================================================

This program might be useful for those who are interested in or major in atmospheric science.
This is a Chinese version. I'll add English annotations later. Check Wiki for more details.

Hope you'll enjoy it!
